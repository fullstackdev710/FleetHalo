                                 FleetHalo recognizes that no two fleets are alike, which means their fleet management processes and requirements also vary. In the field service industry, fleet dispatchers need to stay connected with their drivers to optimize routing and service call assignments. They need to make dynamic decisions based on emergency calls, traffic congestion, weather hazards, and service technician availability.

                                 FleetHalo solutions empower field service managers to make data-driven decisions about their vehicles, and meet their business goals such as customer satisfaction, driver safety, profitability, cost control, and minimizing their carbon footprint.
