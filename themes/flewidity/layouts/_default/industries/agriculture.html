                     In the agricultural sector, where operations span extensive areas, different connectivity needs arise. For many, mobile network-based fleet tracking suffices. However, some agribusinesses operate in such remote locations that satellite connectivity becomes essential for ensuring driver safety. FleetHalo provides both solutions. Integrating a satellite modem with your agricultural vehicle tracking devices through FleetHalo ensures comprehensive coverage. This setup includes additional man-down alerts, a crucial feature for scenarios where workers are beyond the reach of standard service ranges.
