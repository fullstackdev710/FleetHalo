                                 Trailer fleet management involves collecting, observing, and analyzing data associated with tow trucks and trailers. Through telematics devices and platforms, towing companies can monitor vehicle health, pinpoint locations, and understand usage trends. Fleet managers and dispatchers have the ability to oversee driving safety scorecards, determine the nearest vehicle for service calls, and observe driving behaviors such as speeding, harsh braking, and excessive idling. This information can be consolidated for comprehensive analysis, aiding in identifying both vehicle maintenance needs and opportunities for driver training.
