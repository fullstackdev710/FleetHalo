title: "What is the purpose of Fleet Telematics?"
description: "Telematics devices are engineered to gather data produced by the vehicle, including GPS position, speed, engine light information, engine faults, and fuel consumption. MyFleet Halo collects extra data for electric vehicles, such as real-time charge levels, charging locations and durations, and battery health, empowering fleet managers to efficiently oversee their EVs and directly compare their performance with conventionally fueled vehicles in the fleet. The telematics device transmits this data to the cloud, making it accessible for review and analysis on a fleet management platform."
